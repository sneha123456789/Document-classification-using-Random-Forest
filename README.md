# Document-classification-using-Random-Forest

     Supervised machine learning is where you have an input variable and output variable and can use an algorithm to learn mapping function from input to the output. The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.
Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.

Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.
