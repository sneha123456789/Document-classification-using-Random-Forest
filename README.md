# Document-classification-using-Random-Forest

  Supervised machine learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data. The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.   
Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.

Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.
