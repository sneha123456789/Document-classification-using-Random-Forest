Supervised Machine Learning
    
    The majority of pratical machine learning uses supervised learning. Supervised learning is where you have input variables and an output variable and can use an algorithm to learn mapping function from the input to the input     
The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.
Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.

Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.
